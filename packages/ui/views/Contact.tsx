      <h3>Organizer</h3>
      <p>
        Simone Cooper was also the founder and organizer of AmberCon UK, the first Amber Diceless Role Playing Game
        convention to take place outside of the US, and in fact outside of Detroit, the game's birthplace.
      </p>

      <p>
        After running the convention successfully for four years, Simone moved to Portland, Oregon in 1996, where she
        discovered McMenamins Edgefield, an AmberCon waiting to happen.

      <h3>Game Book Goddess</h3>
      <p>
        As a child Amber Cook looked up and saw the Zelazny books on her grandparent's bookshelf. Her father noticed and
        laughed, and said she was named after them. She couldn't wait to get old enough to read them. This was all fine
        until one day during her freshman year at college she decided to reread 'Nine Princes' and happened to actually
        look at the publication date - which was two years after she was born. Very funny, Dad.
      </p>

      <p>Amber 'wrastles' with the Game Schedule, and it usually wins.</p>
