# Ambercon

This site contains the websites for the role playing conventions [AmberconNW](https://amberconnw.org) and [Ambercon US](https://ambercon.com).

This monorepo contains various support packages under `pacakges`, and then the two main entry points (websites) under `apps`. 

Development is somewhat limited since I don't have a set of appropriate fake data to use, so you need to contact me to get a relevant backup of the live database to run locally.
