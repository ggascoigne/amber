Welcome to Ambercon! The next Ambercon - the <ConventionOrdinal />  - will be from <ConventionsDatesFull pre='' intra='through' post='!' />

Ambercon was originally devoted to Roger Zelazny's worlds of Amber and Phage Press's
**Amber Diceless RPG** by Erick Wujcik. It has expanded over the years to encompass other diceless and indie
RPGs of all kinds, and most recently Rite Publishing's **Lords of Gossamer and Shadow**, a new take and
expansion upon the Amber Diceless gaming rules. Many games will expect some passing knowledge of at least the main
characters and basic plot points of Zelazny's Amber novels.

Ambercon is a broad-spectrum diceless gaming and indie gaming convention! We've got superheroes, musketeers, characters from various fictional settings we won't name here due to fear of lawsuits, SOE operatives, cowboys, and, of course, Amber-based games... you name it, we'll game it!
