We will once again be at the Embassy Suites Livonia.

You can see a general layout of what the rooms are like on the Embassy Suites web page (for the moment, the hotel has a few pictures online that you can look at). Each room has a coffee machine (and they are very generous when you ask housekeeping for extra coffee/tea/sugar/etc.), a microwave, and a small fridge, along with a sink in the kitchenette area. In the living room there is a table with four chairs, a couch that converts to a pull-out bed, a lounge chair, a coffee table, end table and TV. There are hair dryers and a second TV in the bedroom, and those neat alarm clocks that will let you set two alarm times. Each room has voice mail, and high speed internet access is available for a fee.

This particular Embassy Suites is nice in that it has a beautiful open atrium, with waterfalls, streams, and plants. There's also an indoor pool and an exercise room. With your room you also get a complimentary cooked-to-order breakfast (real food, not just bagels and donuts) and two free drinks each evening at the manager's reception.

There is a restaurant in the hotel, and Embassy Suites is within short walking distance of one or two mid-priced restaurants. There is no fast food within short walking distance, however, so if you want cheap or quick food, we encourage you to bring food you can make in your room. If you have a car (or know someone who does) there is a Meijer's about one mile away, with a grocery in it, and lots of restaurants nearby. There will be a map of local establishments in the welcome area.

Detroit Metro Airport is approximately 20 minutes south of the hotel. If you need a ride from the airport (or bus or train station), read the transportation page.

you can book online, or make your reservations by phone, if you prefer.
