Ambercon US is a fully scheduled role-playing game convention devoted diceless / story-focused / character driven
RPGs. While a large portion of the games use Erick Wujcik's **Amber Diceless RPG** as their base ruleset, or are set in
Roger Zelazny's **Amber** universe, it also includes many offerings of other diceless and indie published games, as well
as a few more traditional games, and sometimes, even a board game slot.

The convention is open to players of all levels of experience; our members are united by their interest in
diceless role-playing and Zelazny's work.

Ambercon <ConventionYear/> takes place <ConventionsDatesFull pre='from' intra='through' post='.' />

If you have never attended an AmberCon before and have questions about the setup or scheduling, please contact
the organizers at <ContactEmail />.

## What do we get?

Ambercon offers a **long weekend** of scheduled gaming events,
**Thursday evening through Sunday evening**. All members choose the game events they wish to play
and receive their schedule in advance of the convention. Likewise, GMs receive their player lists in advance, so everyone
can prepare.

The convention is divided into {configuration.numberOfSlots} event slots:

### Registration
The one-day and two-day registration allows you to play in games on the day (or days) you pick. The three-day registration allows you to play in games Friday evening through Sunday. The four-day registration allows you to play in games Thursday evening through Sunday.

### Game Selection
After you've registered, we'll notify you when the games for the Con are available on our website, and you get to pick those you'd most like to play in each slot. You do not have to pay a per game fee - your registration lets you play in as many slots as you'd like on the day or days covered by your registration type. Once the game book is available, we ask you to send us your list of possible games (we advise picking more than one in each slot, in case your first choice is full).

### Game Scheduling
After the game selection deadline is past, we will assign your games. Once we have everyone scheduled, we send you the list of your games, and we send the GMs the lists of their players, so any prep for the game can be done before the con, giving everyone more playing time.

### Underage Attendees
If you are interested in bringing someone under 18 to Ambercon, please contact us. We have allowed attendees who are under 18, but with conditions and permission of the event GMs, and we are not currently prepared to accommodate attendees under 13. Have your parent or legal guardian e-mail <ContactEmail />. Thanks.

### Game Masters
We always need more games! If you are a Game Master, please consider running one or more games at Ambercon. The players at Ambercon are, generally speaking, experienced diceless role players who are looking to have fun with others in games.  They, and we, are always looking for new games, new game masters, new ideas, new approaches.  So, if you GM, give it a try, run a game.  Please submit a game via our online game submission form.
