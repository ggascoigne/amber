Ambercon US is a fully scheduled role-playing game convention devoted diceless / story-focused / character driven
RPGs. While a large portion of the games use Erick Wujcik's **Amber Diceless RPG** as their base ruleset, or are set in
Roger Zelazny's **Amber** universe, it also includes many offerings of other diceless and indie published games, as well
as a few more traditional games, and sometimes, even a board game slot.

The convention is open to players of all levels of experience; our members are united by their interest in
diceless role-playing and Zelazny's work.

Ambercon <ConventionYear/> takes place <ConventionsDatesFull pre='from' intra='through' post='.' />
