title: Ambercon's COVID policy
---

In order to support the health of our community, and especially those who are immunocompromised:

- **If you are ill with COVID-like symptoms, do not enter any con space or game and let us know.** If you have COVID-like symptoms, even if you don't think it is COVID, even if you know it cannot be COVID, unless these are from chronic issues you know about, avoid direct contact with anyone at the con and let us know.
- **Well-fitting, surgical masks or N95/KF94 masks are required at all times in all Ambercon spaces.** These spaces include the Parliament Room as well as any room where a game is running. The two exceptions to this policy are detailed below. Specifics on allowed masks can be found in the FAQ.
- **During individual games, if there is unanimous agreement among participants**, they may together choose to change their masking behavior. If anyone in the game does not agree to the altered guidelines for any reason, masks remain required. Even if the group lifts the masking requirement, individuals may of course choose to remain masked.  
- **Masks are required at communal gatherings, except when actively eating or drinking.** People who are not comfortable participating in communal meals may take food from the buffet back to their rooms or other spaces at the hotel. If volunteers are available, we will make plates and run them to attendees who cannot safely enter these spaces.
- Outside of Ambercon spaces, attendees may do as they deem appropriate. This applies to all the restaurants, bars, and the soaking pool.


## COVID Policy FAQ

Q: Specifically what type of masks are allowed?

A: Our policy is based on current CDC recommendations for mask use. However, because Ambercon involves lengthy, intense interaction, we have decided to disallow cloth masks. This leaves surgical / procedure masks, and N95 masks. Additionally, because they are commonly available and nearly as effective, KF94 masks are also allowed.

For more details and specific certifications (e.g. KN95, FFP2, etc ) see:
[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html)

Q: Will a masked / maskless field be added to game submissions and the game book?

A: No. While this would make participation easier for those who want to go without masks, it would exclude those who need masks to be used from much of the convention. We have decided that in this case, those health and safety concerns take priority.

Further, creating a game book and scheduling games for separate "masked" and "maskless" tracks would be an unacceptable additional burden on those who handle these already time-consuming tasks.


Q: How should participants in a game determine if there is unanimous agreement on changed masking behavior?

A: We have no set protocol in mind for this, and will instead rely on the kindness and good judgment of our community. That said, we encourage input to be gathered anonymously, so as to avoid pressuring dissenters.

What we have seen work is:
1. Everybody but the GM to close their eyes
2. Everybody votes on removing masks by a thumbs up or thumbs down.
3. The GM checks the results.
4. The GM tells people to stop voting.
5. The GM tells people to open their eyes.
6. The GM tells people the result, without disclosing any numbers or votes.
