title: COVID / Infectious Disease Policy

---

Thankfully, circumstances are significantly improved from last year. Consistent with current CDC guidelines and local county regulations, this year our policy is:

- **If you are ill with COVID-like symptoms, please do not attend.** If you have COVID-like symptoms during the convention, even if you don't think it is COVID, even if you know it cannot be COVID, unless these are from chronic issues you know about, avoid direct contact with anyone at the con, do not enter any con space or game and **let us know.** 
- **GMs may choose to require masking in their games.** To do this, they'll add an appropriate comment in the description of their game submissions, so that players can opt in or out accordingly during game selection.
- Otherwise, attendees may choose to mask or not mask as best fits their circumstances and comfort levels. We ask that all attendees respect each other's masking decisions.
- In order to support the health of our community, and especially those who are immunocompromised, we encourage all attendees to have current COVID and flu vaccines.
