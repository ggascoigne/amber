title: AmberCon NW's COVID policy
---

In order to support the health of our community, and especially those who are immunocompromised:

- **Vaccination with one or more booster shots is required and will be verified at check-in.** We strongly recommend attendees be as boosted as available in their home country. As an alternative to verified vaccination, attendees can supply a Negative PCR test result gathered within 72 hours of the start of the con.
- **Well-fitting, surgical masks or N95/KF94 masks are required at all times in all AmberCon NW spaces.** These spaces include: the Ballroom, the Admin Lodge, Edgefield meeting spaces, and AmberCon subsidized Game Rooms. The two exceptions to this policy are detailed below. Specifics on allowed masks can be found in the FAQ.
- If during individual games there is unanimous agreement among participants, they may together choose to change their masking behavior. If anyone in the game does not agree to the altered guidelines for any reason, masks remain required.
- **Masks are required at communal gatherings, except when actively eating or drinking.** People who are not comfortable participating in communal meals may take food from the buffet back to their rooms or other spaces at the hotel. If volunteers are available, we will make plates and run them to attendees who cannot safely enter these spaces.
- Games will run as normal in subsidized guest rooms. AmberCon NW simply can't run at a reasonable price without this. Subsidized guest rooms are only considered AmberCon NW spaces when a game is running in the room.
- Outside of AmberCon NW spaces, attendees may do as they deem appropriate. This applies to all the restaurants, bars, and the soaking pool.


## COVID Policy FAQ

Q: Specifically what type of masks are allowed?

A: Our policy is based on current CDC recommendations for mask use. However, because AmberCon NW involves lengthy, intense interaction, we have decided to disallow cloth masks. This leaves surgical / procedure masks, and N95 masks. Additionally, because they are commonly available and nearly as effective, KF94 masks are also allowed.

For more details and specific certifications (e.g. KN95, FFP2, etc ) see:
[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html)


Q: Will a masked / maskless field be added to game submissions and the game book?

A: No. While this would make participation easier for those who want to go without masks, it would exclude those who need masks to be used from much of the convention. We have decided that in this case, those health and safety concerns take priority.

Further, creating a game book and scheduling games for separate "masked" and "maskless" tracks would be an unacceptable additional burden on those who handle these already time-consuming tasks.


Q: Can we have badge markers to indicate social distancing preferences?

A: Yes. We'll acquire red, yellow, and green stickers for attendees to use on their badges.


Q: Can we move our games outside and play unmasked?

A: Yes, if everyone in the game agrees. Unfortunately, the weather in Troutdale in November is variable, so this isnâ€™t an option the game book can be planned around.


Q: How should participants in a game determine if there is unanimous agreement on changed masking behavior?

A: We have no set protocol in mind for this, and will instead rely on the kindness and good judgment of our community. That said, we encourage input to be gathered anonymously, so as to avoid pressuring dissenters.
