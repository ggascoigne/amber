title: COVID / Infectious Disease Policy

---

Thankfully, circumstances are significantly improved from last year. Consistent with current CDC guidelines and Multnomah county regulations, this year our policy is:

- **If you have any out of the ordinary cold or flu-like symptoms, please do not attend.** If you become symptomatic during the convention, we ask that you isolate and avoid all AmberCon NW spaces, including game rooms. If your room is a game room, we will reassign those games to other rooms.
- **GMs may choose to require masking in their games.** To do this, they'll add an appropriate comment in the "Character/Player Instructions & Restrictions" section of their game submissions, so that players can opt in or out accordingly during game selection.
- Otherwise, attendees may choose to mask or not mask as best fits their circumstances and comfort levels. We ask that all attendees respect each other's masking decisions.
- We encourage all attendees to have current COVID and flu vaccines, out of respect for members of our community who may be immunocompromised.
