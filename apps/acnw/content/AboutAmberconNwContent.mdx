AmberCon Northwest is a fully scheduled role-playing game convention devoted diceless / story-focused / character driven
RPGs. While a large portion of the games use Erick Wujcik's **Amber Diceless RPG** as their base ruleset, or are set in
Roger Zelazny's **Amber** universe, it also includes many offerings of other diceless and indie published games, as well
as a few more traditional games, and even a board game slot.

The convention is open to players of all levels of experience; our members are united by their interest in
diceless role-playing and Zelazny's work.

ACNW <ConventionYear/> takes place <ConventionsDatesFull pre='from' intra='through' post='.' /> Additionally, there are usually
pre-convention dinners and Portland-area activities, both organized and informal, on the Wednesday before and the
Monday after the convention.

If you have never attended an AmberCon before and have questions about the setup or scheduling, please contact
the organizers at <ContactEmail />.

## What do we get?

AmberCon NW offers a **long weekend** of scheduled gaming events,
**Thursday evening through Sunday evening**. All members choose the game events they wish to play
and receive their schedule in advance of the convention. Likewise, GMs receive their player lists in advance, so everyone
can prepare.

The convention is divided into {configuration.numberOfSlots} event slots:

AmberCon aims to provide game spaces for every slot any member chooses to attend.
You can commit to attend as many or as few slots as you wish when you choose your events from the game schedule,
which is published in September. Schedules from past conventions are available [Past Conventions](/game-history)

All ACNW events are run by volunteer member GMs -- this could mean you! For a 150-person convention we need
about 25 games in each of the event slots -- that's 150 events! We hope almost every attendee will think about
running at least one event. Check out the Become a GM section here on the web site to learn more.
