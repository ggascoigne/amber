AmberCon Northwest is a fully scheduled, diceless and indie role-playing convention held annually in Troutdale, Oregon, just east of Portland.
ACNW was originally inspired by Roger Zelazny's **Chronicles of Amber** and Erick Wujcik's **Amber Diceless Role-Playing**,
but most games do not require knowledge of Zelazny's Amber novels or the Amber DRP.

<ConventionYear /> marks AmberCon Northwest's <ConventionOrdinal /> year, returning to the venue that makes it unique,
[McMenamins Edgefield Bed and Breakfast Resort](https://www.mcmenamins.com/edgefield).

Use this site to learn how an AmberCon works; explore the venue; register for the convention; submit game events
to the organizers; sign up for games when the event book is published; and check out the event books from past
AmberCon Northwests.
