## McMenamins Edgefield

AmberCon Northwest returns to the McMenamins Edgefield Bed and Breakfast
Resort in Troutdale for its <ConventionOrdinal/> year. This superb historic hotel complex includes a
spa with outdoor garden soaking pools, three pubs, a fine-dining
restaurant, movie theatre, wine tasting room, on-site brewery and distillery,
golf course, and comfortably furnished game and accommodation rooms -- all
decorated by local Northwest artists. Please visit the
[McMenamins Edgefield](https://www.mcmenamins.com/edgefield)
web site to see photos of the estate, read the wine lists and menus, or
investigate the history of this Oregon landmark.

Note: "bed & breakfast style" means that many of the rooms
at the Edgefield are served by separate but private bathrooms on the halls,
though some rooms have been updated to include _en suite_ facilities.

### Administrator's Lodge

The Administrator's lodge is a lovely, separate house beside the main
lodge. In addition to queen, king, and double queen rooms it also includes
a living-room space used for larger games. The Admin Lodge requires a
Wednesday - Monday stay.

### Winery Wing

Each year AmberCon Northwest completely takes over this wing of the hotel.
Almost all of the Winery Wing rooms have now been converted to Queen, King,
and Double Queen suites with _en-suite_ bath facilities. Many of these
rooms are also "Gaming Rooms."

### "Gaming Room" Credit!

Several Double Queens, Double Queen Suites, Kings, and King Suites have
been reserved by the convention for game play. If you book space in these rooms
the convention will contribute {configuration.gameRoomCredit} towards the cost.
Gaming rooms require a minimum Thursday through Monday stay.

## Rooming at AmberCon NW

Prices are set by the hotel. **They are subject to change** before the convention fixes
them in October, <ConventionYear/>.

To make a room reservation for your stay at AmberCon NW please complete
our Registration Form. **Do not make reservations directly with the hotel.**

McMenamins adds a {configuration.moreThanDoubleOccupancySurcharge} charge for each person over 2 in
room. Price shown does not include {configuration.oregonHotelTax} hotel tax.

### Rooms with bath facilities "down the hall" bed & breakfast style

Note that there are limited numbers of each room type in the hotel; if you
are flexible about your accommodation, let us know so that someone
with less flexibility can get first chance at special rooms such as ones with
accessible tubs. Our registration form updates room availability dynamically.
However, in the event of an error, please let us know your second choice room
type in case your first choice is not available. Also, if you would like to
be on the waiting list for a room type that was sold out when you registered,
indicate that also. There are often changes and cancellations during the year
that allow us to bump attendees up into their preferred room type.

<span>*</span> Game Rooms: These are suites reserved for game play. Members who choose to have a Game room, will receive
a {configuration.gameRoomCredit} credit towards the room cost. Be advised that while we will do our best to make sure that
the rooms are used for games you are actually in, in exchange for the credit the game space will be scheduled **at the discretion
of the organizers**.

Game rooms are only available for members who are staying at the hotel from
**Thursday** until **Monday**.
