title: AmberCon NW's COVID policy
---

In order to support the health of our community, and especially those who are immunocompromised:

- **Vaccination and a recent booster is required and will be verified at check-in.** As an alternative to verified vaccination, attendees can supply a Negative PCR test result gathered within 72 hours of the start of the con.
- **Surgical or N95 masks are required at all times in all AmberCon NW spaces.** These spaces include: the Ballroom, the Admin Lodge, Edgefield meeting spaces, and AmberCon subsidized Game Rooms. The two exceptions to this policy are detailed below.
- If during individual games there is unanimous agreement among participants, they may together choose to change their masking behavior. If anyone in the game does not agree to the altered guidelines for any reason, masks remain required.
- **Masks are required at communal meals, except when actively eating or drinking.** People who are not comfortable participating in communal meals may take food from the buffet back to their rooms or other spaces at the hotel. If volunteers are available, we will make plates and run them to attendees who cannot safely enter these spaces.
- Games will run as normal in subsidized guest rooms. AmberCon NW simply can't run at a reasonable price without this.
- Outside AmberCon NW spaces, attendees may do as they deem appropriate. This applies to all the restaurants, bars, and the soaking pool.
