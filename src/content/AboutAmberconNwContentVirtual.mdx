## What is AmberCon NW?

AmberCon Northwest is a fully scheduled role-playing game convention devoted to Roger Zelazny's worlds of Amber
using Phage Press's Amber Diceless RPG by Erick Wujcik, and other diceless / story-focused / character driven
RPGs.

The convention is open to players of all levels of experience; our members are united by their interest in
diceless role-playing and Zelazny's work.

ACNW <ConventionYear/> will take place virtually, facilitated through a private Discord server,
<ConventionsDatesFull pre='from' intra='through' post='.' /> There will be virtual "tours" of the Discord space
and introductions to use of Discord led by volunteers in the weeks preceding the convention. Games may take
place using Discord with or without video or through other technology as organized separately by the GMs.

If you have never attended an AmberCon before and have questions about the setup or scheduling, please contact
the organizers at <ContactEmail />.


## What do we get?

AmberCon NW offers a **long weekend** of scheduled gaming events,
**Thursday evening through Sunday evening**. All members choose the game events they wish to play
and receive their schedule in advance of the convention. Likewise, GMs receive their player lists in advance, so everyone
can prepare.

[comment]: <> (We are charging **${configuration.virtualCost}** to support ACNW's annual expenses.)

Virtual AmberCon NW is **FREE** this year.

The convention will be divided into seven 4-hour event slots:

<SlotDescriptionList />

These times were chosen to maximize the ability of our East Coast U.S., English, and European attendees to
participate. You may attend as many or as few slots as you feel comfortable attending, but we will ask you to
choose and commit to them in advance using our regular game scheduling and assignment process. In other years,
AmberCon has been able to provide game spaces for every slot any member chooses to attend. This year, depending
on the number of games that come in during our very constrained submission time, we may have to give some pass
times. As always, we will provide a way for you to indicate your highest priority games.

Though the formal slots are four hours long, GMs are welcome to run longer games that run over more than one
slot time. Any variations will be noted in the game book.

There may also be additional game events hosted at other times, particularly for the UK and European attendees.
Those games will be organized separately.

All ACNW events are run by volunteer member GMs -- this could mean you! For a 150-person convention we need
about 25 games in each of the event slots -- that's 175 events! We hope almost every attendee will think about
running at least one event. Check out the Become a GM section here on the web site to learn more.
