## McMenamins Edgefield

AmberCon Northwest returns to the McMenamins Edgefield Bed and Breakfast
Resort in Troutdale for its <AcnwOrdinal/> year. This superb hotel complex includes a
spa with extensive outdoor garden soaking pools, three pubs, a fine-dining
restaurant, movie theatre, wine tasting room, on-site brewery and distillery,
golf course, and comfortably furnished game and accommodation rooms -- all
decorated by local Northwest artists. Please visit the
[McMenamins Edgefield](https://www.mcmenamins.com/edgefield)
web site to see photos of the estate, read the wine lists and menus, or
investigate the history of this Oregon landmark.

Note: "bed & breakfast style" means that many of the rooms
at the Edgefield are served by separate but private bathrooms on the halls,
though some rooms have been updated to include _en suite_ facilities.

### Administrator's Lodge

The Administrator's lodge is a lovely, separate house beside the main
lodge. In addition to queen, king, and double queen rooms it also includes
a living-room space used for larger games. The Admin Lodge requires a
Wednesday - Monday stay.

### Winery Wing

Each year AmberCon Northwest completely takes over this wing of the hotel.
Almost all of the Winery Wing rooms have now been converted to Queen, King,
and Double Queen suites with _en-suite_ bath facilities. Many of these
rooms are also "Gaming Rooms."

### "Gaming Room" Discount!

Several Double Queens, Double Queen Suites, Kings, and King Suites have
been reserved by the convention for game play. If you book space in these rooms
the convention will contribute {configuration.gameRoomSubsidy} per night on Thurs-Sun towards the cost.
Gaming rooms require a minimum Thursday through Monday stay.

## Rooming at AmberCon NW

Prices are set by the hotel. **They are subject to change** before the convention fixes
them in October, <ConventionYear/>.

To make a room reservation for your stay at AmberCon NW please complete
our Registration Form. Do not make reservations directly with the hotel.

McMenamins adds a {configuration.moreThanDoubleOccupancySurcharge} charge for each person over 2 in room. Price shown does
not include {configuration.oregonHotelTax} hotel tax.

### Rooms with bath facilities "down the hall" bed & breakfast style

Note that there are only 4 Twin rooms in the entire hotel; if you
are flexible about your accommodation, please let us know so that someone
with less flexibility can get first chance at these rooms. Aside from
this, accommodation will be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis.
When registering, please let us know your second choice in case your first
choice is not available.

Game Rooms: These are suites reserved for game play and the listed price includes a {configuration.gameRoomSubsidy} discount from ACNW for gaming
nights. Be advised that while we will do our best to make sure that the rooms
are used for games you are actually in, in exchange for the discount the game
space will be scheduled **at the discretion of the organizers**.

Prices in red indicate the reduced rate offered by the convention on
those nights. This rate does not apply outside of the time of the
convention.
